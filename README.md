#### General Overview
* Web App/PWA for mobile and desktop
* Purpose is to provide user with cheaper alternatives to brand name products
* App will take a picture as input and return amazon links for purchasing cheaper/similar items

#### Workflow
* App should have a simple user interface
* Takes in an image from the user
* May want to have some additional inputs such as dropdowns to add more details to the image
* App will then reach out to Gemini for suggested alternatives based on the picture received
* Using the suggestions from Gemini, then reach out to Amazon's API to get specific item listings
* Display these listings in an easily navigatable manner for the user
* Links should be provided to bring the user directly to the Amazon listing
* Purchases that users make using our links should provide us some return from the Amazon affiliate program
